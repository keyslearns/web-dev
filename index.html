        <h1><center>La vie d'Abdul</center></h1>
        <h2><u>Early Life</u></h2>
        <p>Growing up in South London-Kenninngton life was relatively normal and similar to every other youngster in london. My ambition and goals in life was to become a professional football player. This passion and dream of mine resulted in me playing for my local grassroot team <a href="https://www.lambethtigersfc.org" target="_blank"><strong>Lambeth Tigers.</strong></a> This lead to me getting scouted to trail for Watford development team whom I eventually played for during the 2014-2015 season as a central attacker, winning the <a href="https://www.thefa.com/competitions/fa-youth-cup" target="_blank">FA Youth Cup</a> with the under 10's side. I also attended <a href="https://www.thegemfederation.co.uk/keyworth-primary/" target="_blank">Keyworth Primary School</a>. From young I always enjoyed nnumeracey and thrived in maths finding comfort in learning a subject where questions usually only had one answer compared to subjects such as English where answers where somewhat subjective.</p>

        <h1><u>Teen Life</u></h1>
        <p>During my teen years these previouse aspirations I had of playing sports at the highest level were dimished due to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acl-injury/symptoms-causes/syc-20350738#:~:text=An%20ACL%20injury%20is%20a,to%20your%20shinbone%20(tibia).">ACL injury</a>I sustained during the 2017-2018 season I had with Watford's Academy side. This inevitably caused me to find alternatives to what I wanted to do in the future. This period was also the point in which I picked the GCSE's I wanted to study. These were: <br> <ul>
            <li>Mathematics</li>
            <li>English Literature</li>
            <li>English Language</li>
            <li>French</li>
            <li>Triple Science</li>
            <li>Physcial Education</li>
        </ul>
        This period is where I fell in love with maths and due to the intricate and therefore creative nature of it. The thought of using different topics and ways of working in math yet still coming to exact same conclusion amazed me all the way till sixth form where I unsuprisingly took both math and furthermath a levels.

        </p>

        <h1><u>Life Now</u></h1>
        <p>Although I loved math at sixth form I realised I couldn't pursue pure math as a career due arguably boring nature of jobs which I would be therefore doing. This is when I was introduced to the world of programming. Despite it not being very calculus focused my experience with coding so far has made me realise I did not fall in love with the numbers within math rather the problem solvig nature of the subject. This same characteristic is present in the profession of software development.</p>
